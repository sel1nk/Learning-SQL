## About My Queries

❓This repository documents my learning journey in SQL as I explored how to 
✅design and ✅manage a company database from scratch, ✅creating tables for employees, branches, clients, and suppliers, ✅writing queries and functions that simulate real-world business operations. 

🔆Through this hands-on practice, I strengthened my understanding of relational databases, data relationships, and core SQL functionalities. It’s a reflection of my progress and growth in backend development and database management.
